<h2>
    Ingredients:
</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 vanilla bean (split lengthwise and scraped)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter (plus 3 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup pastry flour</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons dark rum</li>
        <li>3 ounces beeswax (finely chopped (about 1/3 cup))</li>
    </uo>

<h2>
    Steps:
</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the milk, vanilla bean, and its scrapings. 
            Bring the milk to the scalding point over medium high heat, 
            then remove the pan from the heat and add the 3 tablespoons of butter. 
            Set aside to cool to lukewarm.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar and flour. 
            In a separate small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, eggs and rum. 
            Whisk the egg mixture into the sugar and flour mixture, then whisk in 
            the lukewarm milk mixture. Strain into a container; cover and refrigerate 
            for at least 12 hours and up to 48 hours, the flavors will develop as the 
            mixture sits.</li>
        <li>If using copper molds, melt the beeswax in a saucepan over low heat. 
            Add the remaining 3/4 cup butter to the melted wax and stir until the 
            butter is melted. Remove the mixture from the heat and, using a narrow 
            pastry brush, carefully coat the inside of 18 (2 by 1-inch) canneles 
            molds. (Dedicate this brush to canneles making because the wax will get 
            into the brush.) If the wax mixture starts to set up or thicken, return 
            it to the heat for a moment until it thins.</li>
        <li>If using silicone molds, there is no need to coat them. However, they 
            should be placed in the freezer for at least 30 minutes prior to 
            using, in order to help develop a nice crust.</li>
        <li>Remove the batter from the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before 
            baking it.</li>
        <li>Place your molds on a rimmed baking sheet. When you’re ready to bake, 
            fill each mold almost to the top. Place the molds on the middle rack of 
            your preheated oven.</li>
        <li>Bake them for 15 minutes at 450F (convection is highly preferred if you 
            have it) then lower the temperature to 375F and bake for an additional 
            45 minutes for copper molds or 40 minutes for silicone molds. If not 
            using a convection oven, make sure you turn the molds once in a while 
            too to ensure even baking.</li>
        <li>Let cool slightly. To remove canelles from copper molds, turn each one 
            over with a pair of tongs and tap until the canelle falls out. If 
            difficult to remove, use a pairing knife to help guide it out. If 
            using silicone molds, use a dish towel to squeeze the bottom of each 
            mold to help remove the canelles. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve 
            warm.</li>
