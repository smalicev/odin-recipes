    <h2>
        Ingredients:
    </h2>
    <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon corn starch</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>4 oz. white chocolate-chopped into small chunks</li>
            <li>¾ cup blueberries</li>
            <li>For Filling:</li>
            <li>2.5 oz. cream cheese softened</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon powdered sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>3–4 tablespoons blueberry jam</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl whisk together dry ingredients: flour, corn starch, salt and baking powder, set aside.</li>

        <li>Cream butter and sugar on high speed for about 2 minutes, until light and creamy. Add egg and vanilla and mix to combine.</li>

        <li>Running your mixer on low, mix in dry ingredients mix.</li>

        <li>Fold in about ¾ of white chocolate chunks, reserve remaining to press on top of cookies.</li>

        <li>Finally, fold in blueberries with a rubber spatula, but do this really gently and try not to break the berries.</li>
        <li>The dough will be thick and sticky. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>

        <li>To make the filling, mix cream cheese, vanilla and powdered sugar just to combine and place in the fridge.</li>
        <li>When ready to bake preheat the oven to 350 F and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>

        <li>To assemble the cookies, scoop one heaping tablespoon of dough and make a deep bowl. Fill with 1 teaspoon of cream cheese mixture and about ¾ teaspoons of blueberry jam.</li>

        <li>Top with ½ Tablespoon of cookie dough and seal any openings. Roll gently to make a ball. Press a few white chocolate chunks on top and sides of each cookie. Before baking freeze cookie balls for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>(if you don’t have enough space or baking sheet in the freezer, place rolled cookies on a tray lined with parchment paper and freeze, and transfer on baking sheet when ready to bake)</li>
        <li>Arrange cookie balls onto baking sheet leaving 3 inches apart, because the cookies will spread while baking. Bake 16-18 minutes. Cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer on a rack too cool completely. </li>
    </ol>
